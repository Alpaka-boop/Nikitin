To make a commit on Git, you can follow these steps:

Make changes to your files: Modify, add, or delete files in your local Git repository.

Stage changes: Stage the changes you want to commit by using the git add command. You can stage all changes by running git add ., or you can stage individual files by running git add <file>.

Create a commit: Once you have staged your changes, create a commit by running the git commit command followed by a commit message. For example, git commit -m "Updated README file".

Push changes to remote repository: If you are working with a remote Git repository, push your changes to the repository using the git push command.
